<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

After successful installnation, to run the project you need to run the run.py file.
In the root folder terminal you can run the command 'python run.py' and then we can see flask will provide link to view the project.

With that link any new user will be redirected to signup page and there they can create account and explore the app.

The app has types of user roles:
1. User : By registering for the first time anyone can get a user role, with user role users can
explore songs, albums and can create playlists and add songs to it. They can also download songs
but premium is required, for that they need to submit a form and the admin should accept it.
2. Creator : After registering any user can become a creator by registering as a creator and get that
role. With a creator role, users can upload songs, create albums and assign songs to it. If users do
something which violates the rules, their uploaded or created content gets flagged and its visibility
is removed for users or removed; or they can get blacklisted and further they canâ€™t perform any
creator actions.
3. Admin : Admin can only be added in the backend, admin can login as normal users and they will
be redirected to the admin page. With an admin role a user can flag content and remove its
visibility in normal users, or they can directly blacklist a user to not do any creator task.

default admin credentials is email_id: 'admin@musica' and password is '12345678'
